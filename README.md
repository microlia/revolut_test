Test:

MAIN TEST: Design a small set of automation test cases with a different scope and priorities for the “Add a new beneficiary” flow. This part off the app can be accessed from the central bottom toolbar button -> “To bank account” -> “Add a new beneficiary”. Note: You can use any framework and programming language, but Appium and Java\Kotlin is preferable. Pay more attention to the quality of the code and its structure, rather than the number of covered scenarios.

BONUS POINTS: Try to find any bugs in the app. Put together a document detailing these bugs in whatever way you see fit.

You can also shortly describe what else could be done and improved in solution that you will provide.
